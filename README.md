# Rick And Morty Info App

This is an app I am creating just for testing purposes.
In this app you can see all the Rick and Morty characters as well as Rick and Morty episodes

# Features
- In this first example I am not using any library.
- The architectural pattern followed is MVVM.
- Every view is created programmatically, not a single storyboard is used, but, it is based on Autolayout.
- I create my own cache for images and API calls.
- I created my own HTTP networking client with URLSession.
- The app also has pagination.
- The settings tab is developed using SwiftUI

# Working On

# To be completed
